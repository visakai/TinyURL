# TinyURL
Shorten any long URL into a smaller one, which can be used to visit original URL resource. For example, https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dozens-looters-target-nordstrom-store-walnut-creek-california-rcna6265 would become localhost.com/Af37VsJP And a user visiting the latter would be redirected to the original long URL
